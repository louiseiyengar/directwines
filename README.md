# Project for Direct wines

The project required two pages that called API's and displayed results:

The project can be viewed on github pages:

For the wine cases API:
https://louiseiyengar.github.io/directwines/

For the Zip Code API:
https://louiseiyengar.github.io/directwines/#/zip

(I used HashRouter so github pages would refresh pages without error).


For this project, I used React, React Router DOM 4, and JavaScript's Fetch API interface.
