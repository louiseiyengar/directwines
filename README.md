# Project for Direct wines

The project required two pages that called api and displayed results:
The project can be viewed on github pages:
For the wine cases API:
https://louiseiyengar.github.io/directwines/
For the Zip Code API:
https://louiseiyengar.github.io/directwines/#/zip

(I used HashRouter so github pages would refresh pages without error).


For this project, I used React, React Router DOM 4, and JavaScript's Fetch API interface.

The App will display Flickr photos that have tags matching terms on three buttons -- you click a button to choose a term for photos that match that term.  There is also a search form so that you can view photos that match a term you enter.
